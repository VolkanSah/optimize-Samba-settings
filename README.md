# Optimize Samba for Security and Performance
By these following  tips, you can optimize your Samba Server and provide a faster and more reliable file sharing service for your users.

## Basics

### Use the latest version of Samba.
Using the latest version of Samba can help ensure that you are using the most up-to-date and optimized code. You can check for the latest version of Samba on the official Samba website.

### Use the appropriate SMB protocol version.
SMB supports multiple protocol versions, including SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3. Using the latest protocol version that is supported by your clients and server can improve performance and security. You can configure the SMB protocol version in the Samba configuration file (/etc/samba/smb.conf).

### Configure the network settings.
Configuring the network settings on your clients and server can help improve performance. For example, using a wired Ethernet connection instead of a wireless connection can provide a faster and more stable network connection. You can also optimize the network settings in the Samba configuration file.

### Optimize Samba settings.
There are several Samba settings that you can optimize to improve performance, such as increasing the socket options, setting the read raw and write raw options to yes, and disabling SMB packet signing. You can configure these settings in the Samba configuration file.

### Use an appropriate file system.
Using an appropriate file system on your server can also help improve performance. For example, using an SSD or NVMe drive can provide faster read and write speeds than a traditional hard drive. You can also consider using a file system that is optimized for Samba, such as the Samba File System (SFS).

### Use a caching solution.
Using a caching solution, such as Samba's built-in VFS cache or an external caching solution like memcached, can help improve performance by reducing the number of disk accesses needed to serve requests.

## Advanced Settings
socket options
The socket options setting controls various socket options for the connection between the server and clients. You can increase the SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF values to increase the size of the receive and send buffers, respectively. This can help improve performance by allowing more data to be sent and received at once. Here's an example:


```shell
socket options = SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
read raw and write raw
```
The read raw and write raw settings control whether Samba uses raw mode for reading and writing data. When set to yes, Samba bypasses the standard I/O buffering and caching mechanisms, which can help improve performance. Here's an example:


```shell
read raw = yes
write raw = yes
smb encrypt
```
The smb encrypt setting controls whether SMB packet encryption is used. When set to desired or required, all SMB packets are encrypted, which can help improve security but may decrease performance. You can set this to off if performance is more important than security. Here's an example:


```shell
smb encrypt = off
max protocol
```
The max protocol setting controls the maximum SMB protocol version that Samba will use. Setting this to the latest version that is supported by your clients and server can help improve performance and security. Here's an example:


```shell
max protocol = SMB3
```
You can also adjust other settings in the smb.conf file to further optimize Samba performance. Be sure to test any changes in a non-production environment before making them on your production server.

## Only for Nerds can damage your system)
an example smb.conf file that is optimized for performance:

```shell
[global]
socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_RCVBUF=65536 SO_SNDBUF=65536
read raw = yes
write raw = yes
max protocol = SMB3
server signing = mandatory
smb encrypt = required
strict allocate = yes
oplocks = yes
kernel oplocks = yes
posix locking = no
sync always = yes
use sendfile = yes
min receivefile size = 16384
write cache size = 2097152
deadtime = 15
max xmit = 65535
large readwrite = yes
max log size = 2048
log level = 1

[share1]
path = /path/to/share1
read only = no
valid users = user1
write list = user1
```


This example smb.conf file includes some of the settings I mentioned earlier, such as socket options, read raw, write raw, and max protocol. It also includes other settings to further optimize Samba performance, such as sync always, use sendfile, and large readwrite.

Note that this is just an example configuration, and you may need to adjust the settings based on your specific environment and requirements. Also, be sure to test any changes in a non-production environment before making them on your production server.
